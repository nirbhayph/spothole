# Spothole - Artificial Intelligence Powered Pothole Detection, Reporting and Management Solution

## Spothole Citizen Web/Mobile App

This repository covers the <b>Front End Reporting Segment</b> for the <b>Capstone Project</b> for my <b>Master's in Information Sciences and Technologies</b> at <b>Rochester Institute of Technology</b>. 

### Project Committee Members:

### Introduction

A major problem being faced by municipalities around the world is maintaining the
condition of roads be it summer, the monsoons (when it is at its worst) or any weather
condition as a matter of fact. And although it’s the responsibility of the authorities to make
sure the roads are free of damage, at times they overlook the problem, and most times don’t
even know that the problem exists. According to “Safety Resource Center”, approximately
3 Billion US Dollars are spent by motorists for repair of blown tires, busted axles, and other
damage to their vehicles. Over the past five years around 16 million drivers across the U.S. have suffered damage
from potholes as per an article from “American Automobile Association (AAA)”


Maintaining the road condition is a challenge with constant weather changes, wear
and tear, low budgets for the municipalities. Also, not to forget keeping people informed is
a task. So, this is an app aimed at solving the challenges mentioned. A reporting system,
where the citizen can capture the scene of an area, which will be fed to a machine learning
model that will geocode, validate and track down potholes in the scene. This has been
achieved by training for object tracking on multiple images and developed using
convolutional neural networks. Users can see the damage on the roads using a
mobile application or through their browsers. A dynamic report is also  generated for the closest authority of concern which they can view and update to
create and manage work orders using their own jurisdiction-based web/mobile app-based
dashboard.

### Motivation
In articles covered by Guardian News & Media potholes took a deadly toll in 2017, claiming almost 10 lives daily. IndiaTimes stated that "Bereaved Father Mr. Dadarao" filled 600 Potholes in Mumbai in memory of son he lost in a road accident! Inshorts reported, potholes killed more people than terrorists reporting 14,926 deaths in road accidents.

When we look at the other side of the world, there is a similar situation as reported by American Automobile Association.

Keeping the roads in good condition along with tracking damages is a challenge with constant changes in weather, low budgets for the municipalities. Not to forget keeping the people informed is a task. This project was aimed at solving the challenges mentioned.

### Process Description
The Citizen's App has been Divided into 5 Major Sections. 

#### 1. Create New Report
  * The users can navigate to the add a new report screen either by clicking on the floating action button at the bottom right or from the drawer by pressing the hamburger icon in the app bar. 
  * Here, users have the option to start their report by uploading an existing image of a pothole they clicked by browsing through the file system or by clicking a fresh photo using the inbuilt camera. 
  * Once users have decided on the method for uploading, the image under consideration is validated by the python based deep learning model placed on the backend server to verify if the image uploaded contains one or more potholes. 
  * If the media file contains one or more potholes, the users are presented with an option to share more details about their report. 
  * If not, users are presented with a feedback screen for an invalid image and the option to contact support.
  * Assuming that the uploaded image is validated successfully, users are given the option to select a location (either current (presented after seeking permission)) or to enter a custom location. 
  * After which users are asked to use a progress indicator to specify how severe the reported pothole(s) is(are) according to them.    
  * Finally they are asked to give more details about their report through a required input text area component. 
  * Once the user has successfully submitted the report, they can now view the same using the My Complaints Screen. 

#### 2. My Complaints
  * On signing into the app with their Google Accounts, users are presented with the My Complaints Screen. 
  * Existing users who have at least one report created can manage the status of their report and add additional comments to it or reply on comments from authorities using this section of the App. 
  * Users can click on any of the reports to view the detailed description for the report and monitor any notifications or to communicate with the authority through the chat section. 
  
#### 3. Route Navigation
  * This screen presents the user with an option to enter the source and destination location. 
  * After which a map is presented to the user based on the source and destination location entered by the user. A direction route is rendered on the map for the user. 
  * It displays the route with the marked potholes on the path which were approved by the authorities. It uses Google's Maps API to build the route. 
  * Custom markers for potholes with status approved ranging on severity are presented to the user on the route if they are close to the route.
  * It determines if a pothole is associated with a path using the 'isLocationOnEdge' library function provided by Google Maps.
  * A legend explaining the different attributes of the map is presented to the user. 
  * Also, there is a street view renderer for the users. 
  * This screen can be used by any logged in user to monitor a route and the status for the different potholes on it and plan travel accordingly. 
  
#### 4. Profile 
  * This screen contains the basic details (avatar, name, email address of the user) 
  * It is then followed by a counter for reports with a status of either submitted, approved or completed. 
  * Based on the above counters the user is assigned with a badge score indicating their contribution to the community. 
  * This score is a weighted average score based on the counters mentioned above.  
  * This score can later be used for rewarding the user. (TBD)
  
#### 5. Sign In Screen 
  * This screen contains the option to login using Google. 
  * This uses Google's OAuth 2.0 GAPI for logging in the user. 
  * This also uses the Unsplash API for generating random backgrounds on the side. (When in desktop mode)
  * The app also uses local storage actively to maintain the session state every time in communication with GAPI. 
  * OAuth2.0 Unsplash Logout Local Storage. 
#### Note. Features associated with each screen have been mentioned in the Feature Stack Table.
