            Unsplash), the Google Sign In Button and the App Logo.

          <h3>New Report Screen</h3>
          <h6><i>(Navigate to see all screens)</i></h6>
          <p>
            Users have the option to start their report by uploading an existing
            image of a pothole they clicked by browsing through the file system
            or by clicking a fresh photo using the inbuilt camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once users have decided on the method for uploading, the image under
            consideration is validated by the python based deep learning model
            placed on the backend server to verify if the image uploaded
            contains one or more potholes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the media file contains one or mpre potholes, the users are
            presented with an option to share more details about their report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming that the uploaded image is validated successfully, users
            are given the option to select a location (either current (presented
            after seeking permission)) or to enter a custom location
          </p>
          <p>
            After which users are asked to use a progress indicator to specify
            how severe the reported pothole(s) is(are) according to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally they are asked to give more details about their report
            through a required input text area componenet. Once the user has
            successfully submitted the report, they can now view the same using
            the My Complaints Screen.
